Alex is now about 22 months old, and he's been wonderful in almost all aspects except one: he has never slept through the night, and it often takes an exhausting _hour_ of singing, bouncing, and praying to get him to go to sleep.

As a newborn, we had reasonable success putting him down to sleep in his bassinet or cot. But one day, we simply could not put him down any more. I distinctly remember those moments held with bated breath, attempting to lower him into the cot while keeping him steady and feeling like I was holding a literal bomb. Praying that _this time_, oh God please let him go down easily just this one more time. And then the inevitable crying, the agony, the frustration, and the eventual resignation.

There would be naps where I would literally hold him for the entire hour or two, because I didn't have the physical or emotional energy of going through the failure of putting him down. Not after all my effort soothing him to sleep in the first place. There were times when Alice would literally hold him for _hours and hours_ throughout the night, because it was just easier.

And so we naturally drifted into the pattern of co-sleeping (and by "we", I mean Alice. I had the luxury of sleeping alone to try and be able to work the next day). It was part survival mechanism, but also our inability to ignore his needs - surely we shouldn't throw him to the cold lonely world of isolation so early in his life?

This continued all the way up until he was about 18 months old. We lay down some mattresses on the floor so that rolling off the bed wouldn't be so terrifyingly consequential. We were breastfeeding him exclusively, and co-sleeping definitely made that more convenient.

Ultimately, the situation was unsustainable. Alice hadn't had a proper night's sleep for a year and a half. We also wanted to start weaning him off breastmilk (he was really only suckling for comfort at this point, not nutrition). Naturally, we decided to start getting him to sleep by himself. I would be in charge of putting him to sleep, as well as settling him throughout the night.

# The difficult part
Co-sleeping was incredibly difficult for Alice, and resulted in abysmal quality of sleep. But in a sense, it was still the path of least resistance. Putting Alex down involved lying next to him and letting him suckle to sleep, and the night-time wakings were disruptive but passive - roll over and let him suckle again.

But now we had to find alternative ways to put him down. I started with what worked for him as an infant: bouncing and singing. When that ceased to be effective, I tried stories. Every single night was an exhausting ordeal which could take up to an hour, or sometimes even more. It began to become something I would really dread.

It was the worst on hotter evenings; after an hour of holding, rocking, bouncing, singing, and being becoming drenched in sweat, he might still refuse to sleep. For a midday nap, that might mean he would just skip that nap. In the evening, it might mean calling in the cavalry and have him fall asleep on the breast again. Either way, it always felt like a complete and abject failure. It's hard to describe how soul-crushing those failures felt, how physically and emotionally drained I would feel, and the sense of relief every time he _did_ eventually go down.

Somehow, it actually got worse. He started refusing to be held at all. Sometimes even the breast wouldn't work. He started tiring of new soothing methods (massages, music, new songs, new stories) more and more quickly. It felt like an arms race that I was destined to lose.

I haven't even started on the _night-time wakings_ yet. He would wake up 2-4 times every night, and it could sometimes take 40 minutes to settle him (although usually closer to 20 minutes). Needless to say, this completely destroys any semblance of sleep quality that I might have otherwise had.

So I began what I now know is called the "graduated extinction" method. I would settle him to the point where he stopped crying, then put him down and leave the room (upon which he would immediately start crying again). I would stay outside for 2 minutes, then repeat the process, this time staying outside for 4 minutes, then 6 minutes. After that if he was still crying, I would go in and take however long I needed to get him back to sleep.

It actually did have some positive effects: he started waking less in the night - only a couple of times now - and he became easier and quicker to settle. Even so, it wasn't enough to preserve our sanity.

This obviously wasn't working. Why did we let it go on for so long before seeking alternatives?

Partly, it was still the path of least resistance. It was difficult, but it was the devil we knew. Trying something different would almost certainly involve a short period where things were even worse. We also had a lot of help from Alice's parents and could rotate the duty of putting the bub to sleep.

Back to the present day - it's January 2023, the bub is 22 months old, we're back in Sydney after a vacation in New Zealand, and we no longer have Alice's parents around to help share the burden. By this time, he had gotten worse and it regularly took over an hour to initially put him down to sleep. It was time to finally, really knuckle down and try and sleep train him properly for real.

It's time for a new plan.



# The New Plan
During a sleepless, frustrated night, I came across a new website and set of articles that I hadn't seen before.

I was immediately drawn in by the problem definition:

> Let me paint a picture for you. It’s been a long evening in the Smith household. Jimmy is 14 months old. Every night, since he was an infant, his parents have rocked him to sleep every night and then put him in his crib, at around 8 PM. His parents put him to sleep, sit down to watch some television and try to relax, but they are dreading the night ahead. Just when they get into bed, around 11 PM, they hear Jimmy crying out. They rush into his room frantically to try to rub his back so he falls asleep more quickly. These awakenings occur for the rest of the night every hour to an hour and a half. When he gets up for the day at 5:30 AM, Jimmy is quite irritable, and his parents are exhausted.

The core theory that was presented is that the child has built _inappropriate sleep associations_, where they need a parent nearby and/or specific soothing techniques to help them fall asleep. And this is the root cause for _both_ the difficulty in settling, as well as the night-time wakings.

> Parents view the awakenings as the problem, but they are a symptom of the primary issue: the child has not learned to fall asleep by himself.

It made so much sense, and all I could do was kick myself for not having tried harder to find this information sooner. In my defense, there's not a lot of time for research when you're busy trying to stay afloat.

First, I need to introduce a few terms and sleep training techniques. Dr Craig Canapari goes into great detail in [his post](https://drcraigcanapari.com/at-long-last-sleep-training-tools-for-the-exhausted-parent/) but I want to summarise them here again with my thoughts.

### Cry it out (CIO, or extinction)
This simply involves putting them down on the bed, leaving, and letting them cry their little lungs out for however long it takes. That might be a minute (yeah you wish), an hour, or even 4 hours.

It's incredibly effective and trains them _quick_, but it's also incredibly traumatic for the parents, and bound to be stressful for the kid. It doesn't seem to necessarily traumatise the kid, but it does raise cortisol levels and it seems to be fading in popularity.

I don't think I can handle this one.

### Ferber method (graduated extinction)
Same as above, but you only leave for a couple minutes before going back in, increasing the amount of time you leave them to cry each subsequent time.

Also very effective and a bit less nuclear, but a lot more effort and time involved. Still a bit traumatising honestly. It's not easy standing outside a room listening to your own child sobbing out "daddy". A minute starts to feel really long.

### Camping out
This involves slowly transitioning from more involved soothing methods (eg, massage) towards independent sleep. The steps could be: massaging for 3 days, then sitting by their bed for 3 days, then sitting by the door for 3 days, then setting outside for 3 days, etc.

This is quite gentle, but it can take a long time. My question is: how do you transition from one step to another? I knew that if I changed from massage to sitting by his bed, I would be sitting there for at least an hour and a half, and I don't know if he would sleep by then.

### Excuse me method
This involves giving an excuse (eg, I'm going to wash dishes) before leaving. It doesn't have to be a good excuse! In fact, this trick [works on adults too](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-convince-people-to-let-you-cut-in-line-5824481).

This method obviously requires the child to be old enough to understand what you're saying. From experience, I know that Alex is quite good at accepting excuses already, so I think this could be a useful idea.

### Sleep fading
This isn't really a technique by itself, so much as a catalyst. It involves shifting bedtime to be a little bit later (eg, 30 minutes later than usual) to ensure the child is more sleepy. It can help make the other techniques more successful. After fading, you do need to slowly bring their bedtime back to the original earlier time though.

I like this idea a lot, because having greater success early on and building those positive associations sounds really useful. The last thing I want is for Alex to associate excuses with "I'm definitely not going to sleep now". It's also very fortuitous timing because we just got back from a vacation to New Zealand, so the jetlag acts as a natural fading agent and we don't have to worry about bringing his bedtime back again.


## The actual plan
My plan involved a combination of a few different sleep training techniques. The core technique remained the graduated extinction method, but there were two main things that I understood after my research:

1. I couldn’t put him to sleep with massage or any techniques that would cause him to be reliant on my presence and involvement. He has to learn to fall asleep by himself.

2. If anything, it was more important to focus on the initial sleep routine rather than the night-time wakings.


I considered trying the graduated extinction by itself, but I was worried that it wouldn’t be very effective because I knew that Alex could and would stand up, walk off the mattress, open the door and go outside his room. I also knew that if I held the door closed from the outside, he would really cry and would just stand at the door until I opened it. I didn’t think this was a very direct path to him learning to sleep on his own; he would probably end up collapsing asleep by the door rather than on his bed, and be quite traumatised too.


I also knew that I had to wean him off the massages, so I liked how well that fit in with the “camp it out” method. However, I was worried that each session of putting him to sleep would then take well over an hour, without the power of the massages. Alex likes to laugh and talk and run around the room and be silly, and I knew from experience that the best remedy to his cheeky attitude was to leave the room, which would cause him to cry. It's much easier to comfort him and let him slide into sleep rather than calm down his cheeky excitement (it sounds terrible to write this out but it’s true).


However, just leaving the room without a word would put him into wailing siren mode immediately, so I decided to take a leaf out of the “excuse me” method. I knew that Alex was very reasonable – he readily accepts excuses and reasoning in other areas too, so I expected that this would work well.


Finally, I mixed in the “sleep fading” technique, which was perfect because we were trying to fix his NZ jetlag anyway, which meant that we could fade without having to bring his bedtime back earlier again.


The final plan:

1. Start bed time 30 minutes later than the day before (sleep fading) to get him more tired and likely to sleep.
2. Wean off massages with the “camp it out” method by sitting next to his bed, reciting a calming script (“daddy’s here, close your eyes and go to bed, I’ll see you in the morning, good boy”) for as long as it seems effective. I would also make regular shooshing noises, which I usually do while giving him massages. If he starts being excited and cheeky, time to lay him back down and move to step 2.

3. Make an excuse as per the “excuse me” method (I always say I’m going to wash dishes) and promise to be back soon, then leave the room.

4. Set a timer for 2, 4, 6 minutes as per the “graduated extinction” method, and re-enter the room once the time is up. Act surprised if he’s out of the bed or crying, remind him that I just went to wash dishes, and repeat from step 1.


# Sleep logs
I maintained some detailed logs during the training period. The first two logs are from the days before we started proper sleep training.

## Friday 20th January
### Noon
Alice and Alex arrive back from NZ! Alex fell asleep in the car back from the airport, and woke up when we tried to move him from the car to his bed. He was probably too excited at seeing home and his old room. He slept for a total of about 40 mins from about 10:20am to 11:00am.

### Evening
I don’t remember when he slept at night but it was probably quite early, around 6pm, due to being jetlagged on NZ time and not sleeping very long for his noon nap. I put him to sleep using the standard techniques: story, and massage on the feet, hands, and face.

### Night
Alex woke at 9:30pm and then again at 12am and again at 2am. Thankfully, in all 3 cases he was fairly easy to settle. I used the standard foot and hand massages with the graduated extinction method, waiting until he was calm and then leaving the room for 2, 4, 6 minutes. He cried quite a lot, but each settling session took under 30 minutes.

### Morning
He woke up some time after 4am, at which point Alice went to cuddle him, and he finally got up at about 5:10am.


## Saturday 21st January
For his noon nap, we put Alex down just past 10am. He went down with the standard techniques without too much difficulty. I think it took around 30 minutes.

I put Alex down at about 6:30pm using the standard techniques. Another 30min ordeal – not too bad.

Alex first woke at 11:30pm. It was difficult to put him back to sleep. I used the graduated extinction method, but he cried and wailed throughout the whole ordeal and I just could not leave him asleep. Even when I was able to leave him asleep, he woke up again after about 10 minutes by himself. I continued to try the same strategy (starting from 2 minutes again) and the entire ordeal took about an hour and a half. I lay awake for at least another hour, frustrated and exhausted, falling asleep some time past 2am.

He woke up at about 6am.


## Sunday 22nd January
This was the first day we enacted the New Plan. We put him down for his noon nap at about 10:30 (half hour fade compared to yesterday). I put him down, told him a story, and then started The Plan. No massages. He did get up and run around the room a little bit, but I managed to follow The Plan. To my utter surprise, he actually managed to fall asleep without me touching him a single time. We did get up to the 6 minute graduated extinction timer and the whole process took about 40 minutes.

At night time, we started his sleep time routine at 6:30pm with his bath, and he was in bed just before 7pm. I follow The Plan religiously, and I’m again successful after about 45 minutes. He does get up and try and open the door, and frequently asks for mum, but I know how to deal with that. Sneakily block the door at the bottom with my hand, and tell him mum is taking a shower. The trick is, mum is always taking a shower.

Throughout the night, Alex does not wake up a single time. That’s right, he literally slept all the way through from about 7:50pm til 5am. It's hard to overstate how ecstatic I was at this development - this was literally the first time in his entire life that he's slept through the entire night by himself.

He did wake up quite early at 5am, but I was so happy I didn’t even care. Perhaps it’s my imagination, but Alex seemed particularly chipper, adorable, and well behaved that day. Maybe everything is better when everyone gets good sleep.


## Monday 23rd January
We put Alex down at about 11:30am (bit late on schedule). He was particularly cheeky and I was really struggling to follow The Plan. He would say “bub is going to sit down as well!” and walk out of bed and sit down next to me, looking at me expectantly. There is no room for humour in The Plan, but I could not suppress a giggle. I can only imagine that only encouraged him. He cried when I left the room for my graduated periods, but stopped immediately when I went back into the room. Crocodile tears. He’s no longer traumatised by the lack of my presence, and immediately resumed being cheeky. Finally, I found him standing at the door smiling after I opened the door to re-enter the room one time. I let him out and he goes down the stairs by himself. The time is 12:15pm and I don’t have a contingency plan for the unexpected interruption to The Plan. I decide to let him play for a bit and try and reset the sleep routine. Alice and I resolve to be boring and refuse to interact with him. I tell him “we’re not going to play with you – go play by yourself and when you’re tired I’ll take you back to bed”. We don’t emotionally traumatise him by completely stonewalling him, but we don’t engage. He doesn’t press the issue because he knows he’s in the wrong. Finally, I take him back upstairs at 12:40pm and he doesn’t fight it. I restart The Plan and he’s asleep within 10 minutes. Relief.

Alex starts his bedtime routine at 7pm and is in bed by 7:30pm. A 30min fade. We’re almost out of “jetlag fade credits” – it’s getting close to the time when we genuinely want him to go to sleep. I follow The Plan and it goes smoothly. He isn’t crying much any more when I leave the room. He actually quietly lay in bed for a whole 4 minutes, and I think he might have fallen asleep if I waited a bit longer. But I wanted to show that I kept my promises, and definitely didn’t want to teach him that crying would bring me back in earlier. He finally fell asleep at 8:10pm, while I was sitting silently and not even making shooshing sounds. Progress.

I hoped that he would sleep through the night again, but it was wishful thinking. Alex woke twice during the night - once at 1am and again at 3:30am. Fortunately, he was very easy to settle each time, requiring only my presence and some light shooshing for less than a minute.

Alex woke up at 6am, quietly getting up and declaring "the bub is awake!" and making it halfway down the stairs before I managed to get out of bed and scoop him up.

## Tuesday 24th January
We got Alex into bed just past 11:30am. He wasn't quite as cheeky as yesterday, but he was definitely still quite excitable. He continued to declare his intention to sit next to me, and subsequently do so, smiling up at me. I got up to 2, 4, 6, 6 minutes, and he actually fell asleep by himself while I was out of the room! The entire process took just about 40 minutes.

We start Alex's bedtime routine at about 7pm again, and is in bed by 7:40pm. He's quite well behaved and stays on the bed the entire time. I get up to 2, 4 minutes and he actually falls asleep all by himself again, with me outside the room. He tends to chatter and fidget while I'm in the room, and actually seems to do a lot better when I'm out of the room. The process took only 20 minutes this time!

Alex woke once during the night at 12am. He was a bit difficult to settle and kept crying when I left the room (how did he even know?!). He was able to fall asleep within 2 minutes without me going back into the room though.

He woke up at 6am crying. Hopefully that wasn't because of being left to cry himself to sleep during the night...

## Wednesday 25th January
Alex started his bedtime routine at about 11:50am today. This time it was very difficult. He refused to lie down on his bed for more than 10 seconds at a time, and also didn't stay in bed when I left the room. I think he might have been a bit overtired, but it's hard to say. I told him that I would only stay in the room with him while he was lying in bed, and had to leave the room twice to let him know I was serious. I'm not sure if threats like that are the right thing to do - it's kind of the opposite of the "excuse me" method. He finally fell asleep after a bit of crying, with me in the room. The whole process took an hour. Feels like a bit of a regression. Maybe the diminished sleep fading is making everything harder.

We started Alex's bath at around 7:40pm and he was in bed just before 8pm. He fell asleep shortly after I told him his bedtime story, without me having to leave the room a single time. He stayed on the bed, didn't sit up, and just rolled over onto his side. The whole process took just over 10 minutes. What a blissful feeling.

He woke up at 2am and 3:30am. At the 2am wake-up, he actually self-settled after under 2 minutes of crying. The 3:30am wak-up required my presence, but he was still quite easy to put down. He whinged a bit after I left the room but was able to settle himself quickly.

He woke up at 6:40am, in a good mood.

## Thursday 26th January
We started his noon nap routine at about 12:00pm, but he was fairly difficult to settle. I tried to quickly shut down all his attempts at being cheeky. That was definitely the hardest part; I naturally wanted to laugh with him and cuddle him, and it was quite difficult to ruthlessly shut that down. I used the "I'm going to go wash dishes if you don't lie down" threat again. I'm still not sure it's the right thing to do. He eventually slept after about 40 minutes, basically crying himself to sleep.

Alex was in bed and I finished by story at 7:45pm. He was very good and fell asleep in 10 minutes. He did ask me to put on his blanket (and proceed to kick it off) a couple of times. I'm worried about encouraging him to seek interaction this way, but it hasn't developed into a problem yet. He also cried out quite loudly for seemingly no reason before falling asleep. I must have left the room a bit too early, because he cried when I left and I had to re-enter after 2 minutes, whereupon he fell back into sleep quickly. Overall the whole thing took just under 20 minutes.

He almost slept through the entire night, waking only once at 5:20am. I was able to put him back to sleep thankfully.

He finally woke in a good mood at 6:40am.

## Friday 27th January
Today was a disaster. We started his sleep routine at 11:50am and he just didn't seem sleepy at all. After an hour of the standard back and forth, I found that he had done a poop in his nappy. I brought Alice in to help me deal with that mess, and then let him go downstairs to play quietly for 15mins. Once he was put back in bed, he continued to resist sleeping. He no longer minded when I left the room; he would walk over and play with the blinds, or climb up and down his cot, or sit up and play with his soft toys. Another hour later, he still wasn't the faintest bit getting to sleep, and so I just gave up. No nap today. Disaster.

We actually had the grandparents (my parents) over to look after him after dinner. This is a weekly routine that we'd like to stick to, so that we can get a little respite. Alice and I were supposed to be back by 7:30pm to put the bub to sleep, but we got back a little late. To our happy surprise, the grandparents were successful in putting him to sleep! They lay on the floor in his room, and Alex was able to fall asleep by himself. The sleep training really is working.

Unfortunately, the grandparents made a critical mistake - they didn't put him in a nappy. Alex woke up with his clothes and bed soaked at 12am. I stripped him down and put everything in the wash, and was able to put him back to sleep without too much difficulty. It took a little longer than usual because the process of stripping and changing woke him up much more than usual.

Alex woke up at 6:40am in a good mood again.

## Saturday 28th January
I was determined not to make the same mistake as yesterday. I think he just wasn't tired. Today, we decided to start his bedtime at 1pm - about an hour later than the past few days. We had also taken him out to Eastwood and he played in the sun in the playground. On top of that, I made sure to tell an extra long story. Whatever the reason, he was able to fall asleep shortly after my story concluded, within 10 minutes. He fell asleep at 1:20pm.

# Epilogue
It's now the 25th of February, over a month since we started The New Plan of sleep training.

He's been really good at sleeping at night, reliably within 10 minutes of entering the room and without much fuss. Even better, anyone can do it! Grandma and grandpa from both sides can put him down without problem. He is truly able to fall asleep independently.

At his noon naps, it isn't quite as wonderful. Recently he's been napping one out of two days - every second day he just doesn't sleep. Perhaps his night time sleep quality is better, so the noon nap isn't needed sometimes? His mood is usually pretty stable on the days that he doesn't nap. A little bit quicker to tantrum but not obviously extraordinarily overtired.

Throughout the night, he sleeps really well. He often sleeps through all the way to 5am, and then again to 8am after a quick settle. Usually that's because he's rolled onto the floor. It might also that he gets a bit cold, because he sometimes asks for his blanket.

Other notes:
 - in the mornings, he'll say "daddy has come into the room, daddy has finished washing the dishes", which is hilarious
 - he always wakes up in a good mood now, and often even leaves the room by himself, muttering "bub has woken up, bub is going down the stairs" which caused me to wake up in a panic the first couple of times

Looking back, the previous sleeping struggles feel like a rapidly fading nightmare. My desperate prayers from back then seem to have been answered, and more. I really wish we started along this path earlier - I think somewhere between the 8-14 month mark would be a good time to transition to this kind of independent sleep.
