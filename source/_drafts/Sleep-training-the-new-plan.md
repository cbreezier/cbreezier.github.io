## Friday 20th January
Alice and Alex arrive back from NZ! Alex fell asleep in the car back from the airport, and woke up when we tried to move him from the car to his bed. He was probably too excited at seeing home and his old room. He slept for a total of about 40 mins from about 10:20am to 11:00am.


I don’t remember when he slept at night but it was probably quite early, around 6pm, due to being jetlagged on NZ time and not sleeping very long for his noon nap. I put him to sleep using the standard techniques: story, and massage on the feet, hands, and face.


Alex woke at 9:30pm and then again at 12am and again at 2am. Thankfully, in all 3 cases he was fairly easy to settle. I used the standard foot and hand massages with the graduated extinction method, waiting until he was calm and then leaving the room for 2, 4, 6 minutes. He cried quite a lot, but each settling session took under 30 minutes.


He woke up some time after 4am, at which point Alice went to cuddle him, and he finally got up at about 5:10am.


## Saturday 21st January
For his noon nap, we put Alex down just past 10am. He went down with the standard techniques without too much difficulty. I think it took around 30 minutes.

I put Alex down at about 6:30pm using the standard techniques. Another 30min ordeal – not too bad.


Alex first woke at 11:30pm. It was difficult to put him back to sleep. I used the graduated extinction method, but he cried and wailed throughout the whole ordeal and I just could not leave him asleep. Even when I was able to leave him asleep, he woke up again after about 10 minutes by himself. I continued to try the same strategy (starting from 2 minutes again) and the entire ordeal took about an hour and a half. I lay awake for at least another hour, frustrated and exhausted, falling asleep some time past 2am.


He woke up at about 6am.


# The New Plan
This pattern wasn’t sustainable. It was time to finally, really knuckle down and try and sleep train him properly for real. Part of the motivation came from knowing that it was just me and Alice now – we didn’t have Alice’s parents to fall back on to help share the burden of looking after the kid. Another motivation was the absolutely terrible sleeping habits that Alex had picked up while in NZ – it took us over an hour to put him to bed each time, and he woke frequently too.


The plan involved a combination of a few different sleep training techniques. The core technique remained the graduated extinction method, but there were two main things that I understood after my research:


1. I couldn’t put him to sleep with massage or any techniques that would cause him to be reliant on my presence and involvement. He has to learn to fall asleep by himself.

2. If anything, it was more important to focus on the initial sleep routine rather than the night-time wakings.


I considered trying the graduated extinction by itself, but I was worried that it wouldn’t be very effective because I knew that Alex could and would stand up, walk off the mattress, open the door and go outside his room. I also knew that if I held the door closed from the outside, he would really cry and would just stand at the door until I opened it. I didn’t think this was a very direct path to him learning to sleep on his own; he would probably end up collapsing asleep by the door rather than on his bed, and be quite traumatised too.


I also knew that I had to wean him off the massages, so I liked how well that fit in with the “camp it out” method. However, I was worried that each session of putting him to sleep would then take well over an hour, without the power of the massages. Alex likes to laugh and talk and run around the room and be silly, and I knew from experience that the best remedy to his cheeky attitude was to leave the room, which would cause him to cry. It was much easier to comfort him and let him slide into sleep rather than calm down his cheeky excitement (it sounds terrible to write this out but it’s the unavoidable truth).


However, just leaving the room without a word would put him into wailing siren mode immediately, so I decided to take a leaf out of the “excuse me” method. I knew that Alex was very reasonable – he readily accepts excuses and reasoning in other areas too, so I expected that this would work well.


Finally, I mixed in the “sleep fading” technique, which was perfect because we were trying to fix his NZ jetlag anyway, which meant that we could fade without having to bring his bedtime back earlier again.


The final plan:

1. Wean off massages with the “camp it out” method by sitting next to his bed, reciting a calming script (“daddy’s here, close your eyes and go to bed, I’ll see you in the morning, good boy”) for as long as it seems effective. I would also make regular shooshing noises, which I usually do while giving him massages. If he starts being excited and cheeky, time to lay him back down and move to step 2.

2. Make an excuse as per the “excuse me” method (I always say I’m going to wash dishes) and promise to be back soon, then leave the room.

3. Set a timer for 2, 4, 6 minutes as per the “graduated extinction” method, and re-enter the room once the time is up. Act surprised if he’s out of the bed or crying, remind him that I just went to wash dishes, and repeat from step 1.


## Sunday 22nd January
This was the first day we enacted the New Plan. We put him down for his noon nap at about 10:30 (half hour fade compared to yesterday). I put him down, told him a story, and then started The Plan. No massages. He did get up and run around the room a little bit, but I managed to follow The Plan. To my utter surprise, he actually managed to fall asleep without me touching him a single time. We did get up to the 6 minute graduated extinction timer and the whole process took about 40 minutes.


At night time, we started his sleep time routine at 6:30pm with his bath, and he was in bed just before 7pm. I follow The Plan religiously, and I’m again successful after about 45 minutes. He does get up and try and open the door, and frequently asks for mum, but I know how to deal with that. Sneakily block the door at the bottom with my hand, and tell him mum is taking a shower. The trick is, mum is always taking a shower.


Throughout the night, Alex does not wake up a single time. That’s right, he literally slept all the way through from about 7:50pm til 5am. It's hard to overstate how ecstatic I was at this development - this was literally the first time in his entire life that he's slept through the entire night by himself.


He did wake up quite early at 5am, but I was so happy I didn’t even care. Perhaps it’s my imagination, but Alex seemed particularly chipper, adorable, and well behaved that day. Maybe everything is better when everyone gets good sleep.


## Monday 23rd January
We put Alex down at about 11:30am (bit late on schedule). He was particularly cheeky and I was really struggling to follow The Plan. He would say “bub is going to sit down as well!” and walk out of bed and sit down next to me, looking at me expectantly. There is no room for humour in The Plan, but I could not suppress a giggle. I can only imagine that only encouraged him. He cried when I left the room for my graduated periods, but stopped immediately when I went back into the room. Crocodile tears. He’s no longer traumatised by the lack of my presence, and immediately resumed being cheeky. Finally, I found him standing at the door smiling after I opened the door to re-enter the room one time. I let him out and he goes down the stairs by himself. The time is 12:15pm and I don’t have a contingency plan for the unexpected interruption to The Plan. I decide to let him play for a bit and try and reset the sleep routine. Alice and I resolve to be boring and refuse to interact with him. I tell him “we’re not going to play with you – go play by yourself and when you’re tired I’ll take you back to bed”. We don’t emotionally traumatise him by completely stonewalling him, but we don’t engage. He doesn’t press the issue because he knows he’s in the wrong. Finally, I take him back upstairs at 12:40pm and he doesn’t fight it. I restart The Plan and he’s asleep within 10 minutes. Relief.

Alex starts his bedtime routine at 7pm and is in bed by 7:30pm. A 30min fade. We’re almost out of “jetlag fade credits” – it’s getting close to the time when we genuinely want him to go to sleep. I follow The Plan and it goes smoothly. He isn’t crying much any more when I leave the room. He actually quietly lay in bed for a whole 4 minutes, and I think he might have fallen asleep if I waited a bit longer. But I wanted to show that I kept my promises, and definitely didn’t want to teach him that crying would bring me back in earlier. He finally fell asleep at 8:10pm, while I was sitting silently and not even making shooshing sounds. Progress.

I hoped that he would sleep through the night again, but it was wishful thinking. Alex woke twice during the night - once at 1am and again at 3:30am. Fortunately, he was very easy to settle each time, requiring only my presence and some light shooshing for less than a minute.

Alex woke up at 6am, quietly getting up and declaring "the bub is awake!" and making it halfway down the stairs before I managed to get out of bed and scoop him up.

## Tuesday 24th January
We got Alex into bed just past 11:30am. He wasn't quite as cheeky as yesterday, but he was definitely still quite excitable. He continued to declare his intention to sit next to me, and subsequently do so, smiling up at me. I got up to 2, 4, 6, 6 minutes, and he actually fell asleep by himself while I was out of the room! The entire process took just about 40 minutes.

We start Alex's bedtime routine at about 7pm again, and is in bed by 7:40pm. He's quite well behaved and stays on the bed the entire time. I get up to 2, 4 minutes and he actually falls asleep all by himself again, with me outside the room. He tends to chatter and fidget while I'm in the room, and actually seems to do a lot better when I'm out of the room. The process took only 20 minutes this time!

Alex woke once during the night at 12am. He was a bit difficult to settle and kept crying when I left the room (how did he even know?!). He was able to fall asleep within 2 minutes without me going back into the room though.

He woke up at 6am crying. Hopefully that wasn't because of being left to cry himself to sleep during the night...

## Wednesday 25th January
Alex started his bedtime routine at about 11:50am today. This time it was very difficult. He refused to lie down on his bed for more than 10 seconds at a time, and also didn't stay in bed when I left the room. I think he might have been a bit overtired, but it's hard to say. I told him that I would only stay in the room with him while he was lying in bed, and had to leave the room twice to let him know I was serious. I'm not sure if threats like that are the right thing to do - it's kind of the opposite of the "excuse me" method. He finally fell asleep after a bit of crying, with me in the room. The whole process took an hour. Feels like a bit of a regression. Maybe the diminished sleep fading is making everything harder.
