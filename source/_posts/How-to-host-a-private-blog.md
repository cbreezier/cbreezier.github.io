title: How to host a private blog

I wanted to write a private blog, primarily chronicling my journey and 
thoughts as a parent, as well as serving as a diary for the growth and 
development of my kids.

This would be a blog that was very personal to me, where my intended 
viewership is mostly myself (or rather, my future self). But I also wanted to be
able to share it with close friends and family.

## Why not make it public?

A normal, publicly accessible website would serve my needs just fine. But I 
had two competing requirements that were completely at odds with each other:

1. I wanted to use the real names of my kids and my partner, as well as 
   upload photos and videos that were completely uncensored.
2. I didn't want all of this to be visible to the World Wide Dangerous Web.

### An uncensored blog

Many people write about their kids and family by using aliases, fake names, 
and censored photos.

If the intention is to write a blog that will be read 
by hundreds or thousands of people that you don't know, then that may be the 
only option you have available to you. That's a completely valid use case, 
and I appreciate some of the blogs from other parents that I've been able to 
glean knowledge from.

However, as a personal blog, the idea just didn't sit right with me. It's a 
bit hard to describe, but I didn't want to feel like I was doing something 
shameful or dangerous. An analogy would be if I constantly used fake names 
when talking to my partner about our children, for fear of the neighbours 
hearing.

It's a kind of pressure that I didn't want to deal with while writing.

## The dangers of the internet

Why do we need to protect the names and photos of our kids anyway?

I've heard a lot of reasons, ranging from the generic "but privacy" to the 
nauseating possibility of someone using AI deepfakes to create pornographic 
material from photos.

However, I found the following argument somewhat more convincing: consent.

My kids are unable to consent to having their personal details published to 
the wide web. And once things are on the internet, you can never take it back.

## Options that I discarded

I considered and discarded the following options:

- a managed service like Blogger with privacy controls
  - I want to host and control the tech stack myself...just because
  - still requires uploading my personal data to a 3rd party
  - finnicky to make people create user accounts and log in
- hosting something that allows logging in
  - much more complex tech stack
  - annoying to use
- throwing basic auth on every page with a shared password
  - very annoying to use
  - can't revoke access to a single user
- IP whitelisting
  - transparently just works for people accessing the blog
  - very annoying to set up
  - between dynamic IPs, CGNAT, and cellular internet, it's impossible to keep
    the whitelist up to date. I had a friend whose IPV6 address kept changing!

I actually tried the IP whitelisting for a fair while, but it ended up just
being untenable.

## Cookie-based shared secret at the load balancer

The idea is very simple:
1. share a link with a shared secret embedded in it
2. upon visiting the link, write the shared secret to a cookie
3. validate the cookie on each subsequent visit

The best part is, all of this can be done at the load balancer/reverse proxy 
(eg, nginx) so it's completely agnostic to the tech stack of the website 
you're trying to protect.

Here's what it looks like in practice:

```nginx
server {
    server_name your.domain;

    # /auth/ endpoint is public access, and will set a cookie from a query param
    location /auth {
        add_header Set-Cookie "authToken=${arg_token};Path=/;Max-Age=31536000";
        return 302 /;
    }

    location / {
        if ($cookie_authToken != 'your-long-shared-secret') {
            return 403;
        }
        # Refresh the cookie
        add_header Set-Cookie "authToken=${cookie_authToken};Path=/;Max-Age=31536000";
        alias /var/www/static/blog/;
    }
}
```

Then you simply share a link that looks like 
https://your.domain/auth?token=your-long-shared-secret
and everything Just Worksâ„¢.
