Why are Chinese people so smart? This has baffled scientists for centuries, 
but the answer may be as simple as this: Chinese ~~idiots~~ idioms.

Specifically, I'm talking about the kind with just four words in it, known 
as 成语 (chéng yǔ). These often come with hilarious and memorable stories, and 
are able to carry a lot of meaning despite their short form.

Here's some of my favourites, because the stories are just so silly.

## 守株待兔 (shǒu zhū dài tù)
_To guard a tree-stump waiting for rabbits._

> There was this guy hunting in the woods, when a rabbit literally runs 
> into a tree and kills itself. <br>
> Thrilled, the man bags the rabbit and has rabbit stew for dinner. <br>
> Henceforth the man went back to wait next to that same tree every day, hoping
> to bag another rabbit.

The meaning of this story is clear - rabbits are dumb and trees are hard.

  <p>Okay fine, the real meaning is that sometimes things happen purely due 
to luck or coincidence, and shouldn't be assumed to be caused by some action 
of your own. Or perhaps the meaning is that we shouldn't rely on luck, but 
rather hard work and persistence.</p>

## 刻舟求剑 (kè zhōu qiú jiàn)
_Carving a mark on a boat to seek the sword_

> A man is traveling across a tranquil lake on a boat. Unfortunately he 
> drops his sword off the side of the boat, and into the lake.<br>
> Not wanting to disturb his peace, he makes a mark on the boat where the 
> sword fell and decides to retrieve it once he's back by the shore.

This story tells us about the folly of bringing a sword, or children, on a 
peaceful boating journey.

  <p>This is one of the more easily applicable idioms. It reminds us to revise
our approach in the face of changing context and circumstances.</p>

## 南辕北辙 (nán yuán běi zhé)
_Riding north when your destination is to the south_

> A man proclaims to the entire village of Sydney that he will be traveling to 
> Melbourne. He gets on his horse and starts galloping northward.<br>
> All the villagers look up from their flat whites in surprise, yelling that 
> he's going the wrong way.<br>
> The man brushes them off and shouts back, "don't worry! My horse goes 0-60 
> faster than your Tesla!"

My knowledge of Chinese geography isn't great, so I've re-imagined it in a 
more familiar country. Still, it's clear that he should've bought a car 
instead of a horse.

  <p>Another easily applicable idiom. It's more important to ensure that you 
are making headway in the right direction towards your goal than to move 
quickly. In fact, moving quickly while moving in the wrong direction only 
compounds the problem.</p>

## 画龙点睛 (huà lóng diǎn jīng)
_To paint a dragon and dot its eyes_

> A man enters a drawing competition and draws a dragon. It's an incredible 
> drawing in all other regards, but something seems to be missing.<br>
> His master walks over, takes one look, and draws in the eyes.<br>
> The drawing seems to come to life, and the man easily takes first place.<br>

Make sure you bring your teacher with you to competitions, and hope you can 
get their help during a bathroom break.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler</summary>
  <p>This idiom refers to the finishing touch that ties everything together, 
or elevates something from good to great. It's a good one to use as a 
compliment when someone makes a good suggestion or amendment to an idea.</p>
</details>

## 画蛇添足 (huà shé tiān zú)
_To draw a snake, then add feet_

> A man enters a drawing competition and draws a snake. It's an incredible 
> drawing and he even remembers to draw eyes.<br>
> He finishes early and starts looking around - his drawing is clearly 
> superior to all the others.<br>
> However, he starts to get bored and decides to add feet to his snake. The 
> judges are 
> appalled by the addition and he takes last place.

Should've just claimed it was a dragon instead, I reckon.

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler</summary>
  <p>This idiom is almost a direct counterpoint to the one above. It 
describes an unnecessary addition that ultimately ruins the original idea. 
It can also be used to caution against overconfidence and showing off 
unnecessarily.</p>

## 自相矛盾 (zì xiāng máo dùn)
_To contradict oneself with spear and shield_

> A man is selling weaponry, and loudly boasts that his spear is so powerful 
> that it can pierce any shield.<br>
> He then picks up his shield and boasts that the shield is so strong, it 
> can block any spear.<br>
> An onlooker then asks, "what happens if you try and pierce your shield 
> with your spear?".

The character 矛 (máo) means spear, and 盾 (dùn) means shield. The term 矛盾 is literally 
the word for "contradiction", which I think is really cool.

## 辞地无银三百两 (cǐ dì wú yín sān bǎi liǎng)
_There is not 300 silver buried here_

> A man has 300 silver hidden under his bed, but he becomes increasingly 
> worried that it will get stolen. He doesn't trust any banks or any other 
> people either.<br>
> One sleepless night, he sneaks out to the local park and buries 
> his silver under a tree. Even then he is worried, so he erects a sign and 
> writes "there is not 300 silver buried here".<br>
> He is finally able to sleep soundly, safe in the knowledge that his silver 
> is well hidden.

Yeah, the silver is immediately stolen the next day.

So this one has more than 4 words and may not be a traditional idiom, but 
I've always loved the story for how silly it is. I don't think there's much 
to explain here - don't be a dumbass.

Perhaps the closest English equivalent is the
[Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).
